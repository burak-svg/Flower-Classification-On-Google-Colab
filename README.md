# Flower Classification on Google Colab

This project provides an example of how to build and train a flower classification model using Google Colab. The aim is to classify different types of flowers using deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview

This repository includes the following:

- A dataset of flower images (can be from TensorFlow Datasets or your own source)
- A Jupyter Notebook for building and training the model on Google Colab
- Instructions for running the notebook and evaluating the model

## Getting Started

### 1. Open Google Colab

You can use the provided notebook directly in Google Colab. Open the notebook with the following link:

[Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

### 2. Upload or Mount the Dataset

You can use a public dataset like the TensorFlow Flowers dataset, or upload your own dataset to Colab. If your data is in Google Drive, mount your drive with:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

### 3. Install Required Libraries

Make sure you have all dependencies installed. In Colab, you may need to run:

```python
!pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
```

### 4. Run the Notebook

Follow the steps in the notebook:

- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model
- Train the model
- Evaluate the model's accuracy
- Visualize predictions

## Results

After training, you should see the model's accuracy and some sample predictions.
